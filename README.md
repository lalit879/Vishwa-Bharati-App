## 🔮 Future Improvements

This project has a solid foundation, but there are several areas for future improvement:

* **Implement Full Routing**: Make all navigation links in the `Header` and `Footer` functional using React Router to navigate between different sections or pages.
* **Activate Interactive Elements**: Add functionality to the image slider in the `Header`.
* **Dynamic Data Management**:
    * Move hardcoded data from components into a separate JSON file or a configuration object.
    * For a larger-scale application, fetch data from a backend API or a Headless CMS.
* **Content Consistency**:
    * Ensure all text is in a consistent language (e.g., English).
    * Replace all placeholder data with real information.
* **Accessibility (a11y)**: Conduct an accessibility audit to ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities.
* **Add More Pages**: Expand the website with dedicated pages for:
    * Admissions
    * Faculty & Staff profiles
    * News & Events
    * Image Gallery
